# UPF_Placement_and_Chaining
This repository releases the source-code of the solutions for UPF placement and chaining problem, proposed in the article "Efficient solutions to the placement and chaining problem of User Plane Functions in 5G networks"[1] and published as open access in  the Journal of Network and Computer Applications. These solutions addresses the UPF placement problem considering the possibility of split UPF functionalities into smaller microservices (VNFs) and chain them together as required by service requests (PDU sessions). To this aim, PDU sessions are modeled as SFC requests (SFCRs).
